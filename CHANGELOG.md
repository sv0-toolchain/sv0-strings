# Changelog

All notable changes to `sv0-strings` are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the library will use
semantic versioning per SPEC.md Section 26 once F0 is reached.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository created as an independently versioned sibling package and pinned as
  a submodule of `sv0-toolchain` alongside `sv0doc` / `sv0c` / `sv0vm` /
  `sv0-mathlib` / `sv0-mcp`.
- Governing specification adopted:
  [`project-specs/sv0-strings/SPEC.md`](https://github.com/sv4u/project-specs/blob/main/sv0-strings/SPEC.md)
  version `0.4.0-draft` (source audit 2026-08-30).
- **License decision recorded (SPEC LIC-001):** `Apache-2.0 OR MIT`, matching the
  other `sv0-toolchain` submodules. `LICENSE-APACHE` and `LICENSE-MIT` added.
- Flat `strings_*` module stubs under `lib/` (SPEC §9 / ARCH-001):
  `strings_types`, `strings_bytes`, `strings_text`, `strings_ascii`,
  `strings_cstr`, `strings_tokenize`, `strings_locale`, `strings_c23`,
  `strings_posix2024`, `strings_legacy`, `strings_unsafe_abi`. No behavior yet.
- `docs/README.md` pointing at the governing spec.

- **`strings_types`: library-local `Option<T>` / `Result<T, E>`** (SS-U06
  decision B). sv0c has no built-in `Option`/`Result`; a user-declared generic
  enum with scalar payloads monomorphizes on both backends. Structured error
  payloads (`Result<_, BufferError>`) use a concrete carrier per domain until
  sv0c predefines the types + lands T0-2d (filed as an M5 prerequisite).
  `test/cases/prelude_option_result.sv0`.

### Notes

- Implementation is **pre-F0**, but Track U (the ~20 upstream capability gaps,
  SPEC §4.4 / §18.1, `UP-001..UP-028`) is now **cleared to the extent it gates
  F0**: the F0-critical capabilities are landed and CI-green on both backends;
  four items are closed to a tractable arm with the deeper arm deferred, and
  three are SPEC-deferred (R0.3 / R0.4). The reviewed deviation list is
  [`docs/f0-deviations.md`](docs/f0-deviations.md); per-item status and commit
  SHAs are in `sv0-toolchain/task/sv0-strings-checklist.Rmd` (Track U rows).
  R0.1 library implementation (Track L) proceeds on that basis.
- LIC-002..LIC-005 (per-file SPDX, standards-text provenance, third-party
  fixture provenance, release-artifact notices) remain open.
